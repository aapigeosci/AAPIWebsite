We welcome all geosciences community members who self-identify as Asian American and/or Pacific Islander, as well as individuals of Asian- and/or Pacific Islander-descent working in U.S.-based institutions. Community members include undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs, faculty, educators, administrators, industry and non-profit professionals, federal employees, researchers, retirees, and more.

We define geosciences broadly as any discipline related to the study of Earth and the environment, including but not limited to research areas commonly found in Earth science and geography departments (e.g., geology, oceanography, planetary science, atmospheric science, cryosphere science, environmental sciences, et cetera). 
Allies who are interested in learning more about AAPI issues are welcome to join our email lists to receive announcements, information on events, and guidance on ways to support the AAPIiG community.
