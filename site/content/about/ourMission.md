Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in Geosciences (AAPIiG) is a grassroots, member-driven organization committed to building a community that supports AAPIs within geosciences. The organization will
- foster a sense of community among AAPI geoscientists;
- empower current and future AAPI geoscientists in their career goals within industry, academia, policy, non-profits, and beyond;
- embrace the diversity of both historical and contemporary experiences encompassed by communities grouped together by the AAPI categorization; and
- advocate for justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion issues in solidarity with other marginalized groups, both within our disciplines and the world at large.
